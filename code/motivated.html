            <div class="tip-card">
                <h3>Stay Positive</h3>
                <p>Surround yourself with positive influences and remind yourself of your achievements.</p>
                <a href="#stay-positive" class="btn">Learn More</a>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="set-clear-goals" class="learn-more">
            <h3>Set Clear Goals</h3>
            <p>When you set clear goals, you create a vision of where you want to go. This clarity allows you to channel your energy and focus on actionable steps rather than getting lost in distractions.</p>
            <p>Writing down your goals helps to reinforce your commitment. Use techniques like SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.</p>
            <p>Visualizing the end result can also increase your motivation. Create a vision board or write a personal mission statement to serve as a constant reminder of your purpose.</p>
            <p>Revisit and review your goals regularly. This not only keeps them fresh in your mind but also allows for adjustments as your journey unfolds.</p>
            <p>Finally, share your goals with someone you trust. Accountability can be a powerful motivator to stay on track.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="break-tasks" class="learn-more">
            <h3>Break Tasks Into Steps</h3>
            <p>Large tasks can feel overwhelming and lead to procrastination. Breaking them into smaller steps makes them more manageable and less intimidating.</p>
            <p>Start by identifying the main objective and then divide it into logical phases or milestones.</p>
            <p>For each step, set realistic deadlines. This creates a sense of urgency without overwhelming you.</p>
            <p>Keep a checklist to track progress. The simple act of checking off completed tasks can boost your confidence and keep you motivated.</p>
            <p>Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. Focus on consistency rather than perfection.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="reward-yourself" class="learn-more">
            <h3>Reward Yourself</h3>
            <p>Rewards can act as a psychological incentive to keep you motivated. They provide a sense of accomplishment and reinforce positive behavior.</p>
            <p>The key is to choose rewards that align with your values and goals. For example, if you complete a week of studying, treat yourself to a favorite snack, movie night, or relaxing activity.</p>
            <p>Avoid overindulging in rewards that could derail your progress. Balance is essential.</p>
            <p>Incorporate both short-term and long-term rewards. Short-term rewards keep you motivated day-to-day, while long-term rewards give you something significant to strive for.</p>
            <p>Celebrate even the smallest victoriesâ€”acknowledging your efforts helps maintain a positive outlook.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="stay-positive" class="learn-more">
            <h3>Stay Positive</h3>
            <p>Positivity is a crucial element in staying motivated. When you maintain a positive mindset, challenges become opportunities rather than obstacles.</p>
            <p>Surround yourself with supportive people who uplift and encourage you. Their energy can inspire and drive you forward.</p>
            <p>Practice gratitude by reflecting on your achievements and the things you're thankful for. This helps shift focus away from negativity.</p>
            <p>Use positive affirmations to reinforce confidence and self-belief. Statements like "I am capable" or "I will succeed" can have a powerful impact.</p>
            <p>Lastly, stay mindful of your inner dialogue. Replace self-doubt with constructive and optimistic thoughts.</p>
